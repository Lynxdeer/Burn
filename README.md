Small web game about <strong>BURNING</strong> things made using entirely html canvas and javascript, entirely not using webgl, and so I guess your potato laptop CPU burns as well? Hey, least ya got french fries now!

I did convert the image to pixels using a python script, though, cause I don't wanna bother figuring out how to do it in javascript.

Maybe I'll change it to use WebGL sometime later! For now, though, enjoy your french fries!
